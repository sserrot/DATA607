### Movie Night

For the past couple of months, a group of friends and I have been scheduling a virtual movie night as a group activity. After someone selected a movie, we would discuss and rate the movie and then store that rating in an offline Excel file. Eventually, one of our group decided to upload our data into a Google sheets document and we continued our process there, while adding metrics such as IMBD ratings and average group ratings. By pure luck, assignment 2 for Data607 involves inputting movie ratings into a SQL database, so I figured it would be a perfect opportunity to consolidate our data and learn how to set up a server on Microsoft Azure.

I've created a public copy simply for the use of this exercise. Ultimately, I hope to create a way for our group members to interact with my output in order to store our ratings.

```{r}
sheetslink <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSjkE78uLem25GEQtzbvZgugAdJz-frrieRSCedT2zu4719tSnNHMqzCfEvtdjmnL5Jeag7LsJgTIEN/pub?gid=0&single=true&output=csv"

movieratings <- data.frame(read.csv(url(sheetslink)))

print(head(movieratings), width =16)

```

This is straightforward to understand when interacting with it personally, but not normalized from a database point of view and hard to maintain as we have to continually add a column each time someone joins.

I mocked up my quick thought process behind how to normalize the dataset

Ultimately, we'll create 3 dataframes that we'll load into a sql database.  

1. People - all the people who have watched, along with date_joined.
  + first_name
  + date_joined
2. Movies - holds movie information and who picked it
  + date_watched
  + movie_name
  + imbd_rating
  + genre
  + picked_by
3. Ratings - holds the movie ratings
  + movie_name
  + person
  + rating
  
  
## Data Cleaning

Start with some quick renaming and data selection.

The last row and the last two columns are  just a summary metrics like a person's average rating so we'll remove that for now.

```{r}
last_row <- nrow(movieratings)
last_column <- ncol(movieratings)

movieratings <- movieratings[-last_row,-c(last_column-1,last_column)]

movieratings <- movieratings %>% 
    rename(c("date_watched"=Date,"movie_name"=Movie.,"imbd_rating"=IMDB.Rating.,"genre"=Genre.,"picked_by"=Picked.By.))

#convert to date

movieratings$date_watched <- mdy(movieratings$date_watched)

```

The ratings are not all the same datatype due to N/As from people not attending so we have to convert to numeric. we can ignore the warning errors as we want to have NAs for where people did not rate a movie to avoid introducing zeros into any summary statistics.

```{r}
str(movieratings)
movieratings[,6:length(movieratings)] <- sapply(movieratings[,6:length(movieratings)], as.numeric)
```


## Person

Let's start with the easiest to set up - Person dataframe. 

I know which columns to exclude to focus on only people names so that makes things slightly simpler

```{r}
colnames(movieratings)

people <- colnames(movieratings)
people <- people[6:length(people)]

people <- data.frame(first_name = people, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```



## Movies 

Data is already mostly cleaned up, we just have to select the columns we care about and drop the rest. we know it's just the first five columns

```{r}
movies <- movieratings[c(1:5)]

movies
```

## Ratings

This seems more complicated as the data itself is in a flat table, but we simply just transpose the people columns to get their ratings and keep the movie_name I used the following links for some guidance: 

[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36136742/transpose-only-certain-columns-in-data-frame) and [Tidyverse Docs](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pivot_longer.html)

we want to drop NA ratings as they are not actually data points - we can simply infer attendance from the existence of a rating or not.

```{r}
ratings <- movieratings[c(2, 6:length(movieratings))]
ratings <- ratings %>% pivot_longer(!movie_name, names_to = "first_name", values_to = "rating")
head(ratings)

find_na <- is.na(ratings$rating)

#remove nas

ratings <- ratings[!find_na,]

head(ratings)
```


I realized I want to add the date someone joined to the person table so I have to do some quick manipulation

```{r}
date_joined <- movieratings[c(1, 6:length(movieratings))]
date_joined <- date_joined %>% pivot_longer(!date_watched, names_to = "first_name", values_to = "rating")

#find first non-na rating
people  <-  date_joined %>% filter(!is.na(rating)) %>% group_by(first_name) %>% summarise(date_joined = min(date_watched)) %>% arrange(date_joined)
people
```


we now have our preliminary tables! Time to set up the Azure database.

## SQL

After creating an Azure account and setting it up on the Azure portal, we now have to connect through R.

###Connect to my Azure Database

I grab credentials from my keyring using the keyring package in r.

```{r}
username <- keyring::key_list("movienightdb")[1,2]
password <- keyring::key_get("movienightdb", username)
server <- keyring::key_list("movienightserver")[1,2]
```


```{r}
con <- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), Driver = "SQL Server", server = server,Database="movienightsqldb",UID=username
,PWD=password)
```

Create the tables based on the data we've manipulated **note that eval = FALSE as I do not want to re-create the tables**

```{r eval = FALSE}
dbWriteTable(con, "watchers", people)
dbWriteTable(con, "ratings", ratings)
dbWriteTable(con, "movies", movies)
```




## read back into R
```{r}
sql_watchers <- dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM watchers")
sql_ratings <- dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM ratings")
sql_movies <- dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM movies")

```

## Summary statistics

Just some quick stats

```{r}
movie_group <- sql_ratings %>% group_by(movie_name)
people_ratings <- sql_ratings %>% group_by(first_name)

mean_rating <- movie_group %>% summarise(avg_rating = mean(rating)) %>% arrange(avg_rating)
mean_rating

people_ratings %>% summarise(rating = mean(rating), movies_watched = n()) %>% arrange(desc(rating))
```

Looks like I am definitely a lenient rater compared to most of my friends and the worst movie we've watched so far is _The Suicide Squad_

I hope to continue to expand on this throughout the semester with any new tools we learn.
